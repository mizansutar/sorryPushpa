<h1>I’m Really Sorry</h1>

<p>
I made a mistake and I hurt you.  
You didn’t deserve that.
</p>

<p>
I respect you.  
I care about you.  
I know I hurt you and I’m truly sorry.

</p>

<p>
You matter to me.

Sorry Radha.  
You are very special to me as a friend.  
Like Radha’s heart is pure, I want to become better in my actions.
</p>

<p>
Please smile 🙂
